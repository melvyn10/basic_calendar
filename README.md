# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 

A user with a busy schedule is able to add important events to a daily planner in order to manage my time effectively

This application consists of 1 html page and a style css file.
The application dynamically generate the business hours , appointment, button and set yo approriate color in one loop. From there it waits for the an hour button to be click and store the appropriate comment from that hour into the local storage.

Before using the moment.js, i created a set of arrays that will format the datetime correctly with the appropriate st, nd, th behind the dtae. I left the code there commented out, as i spent a little time on this. Ultimately, i found a method in the moment.js that does all this.

The following were implemented:
the code to include semantic elements

	Header
	Section

    This code has been validated by W3C Markup Validation Service and error/warnings are corrected or understood.
